# Style and Conventions
- Team instructions are defined in `AGENTS.md`.
- Communicate in Japanese.
- Naming: avoid ambiguous suffixes like Manager/Util/Service/Facade/Runtime/Engine.
- Prefer immutable data handling (except justified performance cases).
- Single public type per file.
- Before coding, inspect 2-3 similar implementations in the repo.
- Keep designs simple (YAGNI/KISS) and avoid premature abstraction.
